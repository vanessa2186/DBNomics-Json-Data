CHELEM-TRADE contains bilateral flows of goods expressed in millions of current US dollars since 1967. Data from UN-COMTRADE and complementary sources are harmonized and made consistent in a multi-level classification spanning the entire world (95 CHELEM individual countries or statistical territories and zones and additional aggregates). Goods are detailed in 71 categories, non-ventilated products (NV) and total products (TT). The elementary product categories can be aggregated by production chains and stages, sections or sectors. Data are harmonized by country pairs and product category; exports from country A to country B are equal to imports of country B from country A.
